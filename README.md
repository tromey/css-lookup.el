# css-lookup.el

*Breaking News* This code has been merged into Emacs and will appear
in Emacs 26.  Please don't report bugs here, instead use the Emacs bug
tracker.

This is similar to `info-lookup-symbol`, but is specific to CSS.  It
uses [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) as the source of its
information, and `eww` to display it.  Once installed you can simply
use `C-h S` as you would in other modes.
